    \item Developer Experience \& AI Tooling
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Created container solution for dynamic NuGet package updates with zero-downtime deployments
            \item Championed MCP servers for agentic workflows and custom prompts to speed up team development cycles
            \item Deployed production services on AKS using Helm charts and multi-stage CI/CD pipelines
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}

\cventry[0.4em]{2015--2024}{Software Development Engineer}{Amazon}{Sunnyvale/Bengaluru}{}
{Built large-scale distributed services in Java (\textasciitilde80\%) and Python (\textasciitilde20\%). Delivered low-latency APIs, payment systems, and multi-device platforms.\newline{}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
    \item AI-Powered Targeting \& Action APIs -- Alexa+
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Built production AI agent system with MCP-like architecture. Enabled LLM-based device targeting for Music, News and Video domains
            \item Designed RAG-style context enrichment with token optimization and Redis caching
            \item Created prompt engineering pipelines with In-Context Learning. Achieved \textbf{90\%+ accuracy} through test harness evaluation
        \end{itemize}
    \item Cost \& Latency Optimization -- Music Recommendations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rebuilt rule engine using composition and strategy patterns. Cut DynamoDB calls and \textbf{lowered costs by 50\%} with better tail latency
            \item Shipped Java APIs handling millions of daily requests. Tuned latency budgets with retry-with-jitter to meet SLOs at peak load
        \end{itemize}
    \item Multi-Device Platforms \& Leadership
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Led Vega OS working group with 20+ members (Principal Engineers, Senior Engineers, Product Managers). Aligned API behaviors across device and cloud stacks
            \item Ran Q4 readiness with load tests, chaos tests and capacity planning. Mentored engineers on design patterns and test coverage
        \end{itemize}
    \item Invoice Generation -- Global Seller Platform
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Built async invoice workflow using S3 and secure SFTP to Deutsche Bank. Added connection pooling for reliable bulk transfers
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}
